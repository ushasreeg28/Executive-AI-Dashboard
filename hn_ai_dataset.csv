46906534,1770331762,topcone,Why a solid app failed without marketing focus,"I’ve built several apps over the years that were technically solid.<p>They worked.
They were stable.
They solved real problems.
Some were even used by paying customers.<p>And yet — they went nowhere.<p>For a long time, I framed this as a distribution problem, or a timing problem, or “I just didn’t push it hard enough.” What I eventually realized is simpler, and harder to accept:<p>Building software and growing a product are fundamentally different disciplines.<p>I enjoy building systems. I enjoy architecture, edge cases, tradeoffs, and getting something right under the hood. I’m comfortable living with ambiguity while a system takes shape.<p>Marketing an app is the opposite. It requires sustained visibility, repetition, positioning, storytelling, and a tolerance for noise. It’s not a phase — it’s the job.<p>In my case, I treated marketing as something I’d “do later,” once the product was good enough. Later never came. Not because I didn’t know it mattered, but because I didn’t want to spend my limited energy there.<p>The apps didn’t fail because they were bad.
They failed because they required a kind of work I wasn’t willing to do consistently.<p>That realization was uncomfortable, but clarifying. It forced me to separate pride in building something well from honesty about what I actually want to carry long-term.<p>Good software doesn’t automatically become a good business.
And that’s not a tragedy — it’s a mismatch.<p>I’m writing this partly as a note to my past self, and partly for anyone who enjoys building but quietly hopes growth will take care of itself. Sometimes the most responsible decision isn’t to push harder, but to admit what game you’re not playing."

Our Assumptions get written down, interviews summarized, experiments run, learnings captured… then everything gets hard to track. Spreadsheets are a bit clunky, Notion seems overkill for this use case, and three months later it&#x27;s hard to track why we pivoted or dumped an idea.
We built ourselves a dead-simple single-page board just to stop losing that history: idea → segment → pain → hypothesis → riskiest assumption → validation method → execution → actual learning. Nothing fancy, no bloat.
Before I assume that&#x27;s a common pain, I&#x27;d rather hear from people who do this stuff more than I:<p>Could you walk me through the last time you ran real validation (customer convos, tests, etc.). How did you actually record and organize what you learned?

I’ve been reading and following HN for years, so I’m really curious to hear feedback from you :)<p>API Unit started out of frustration, not as a startup idea.<p>In several projects, our APIs were no longer simple request-response endpoints. A single business flow meant multiple dependent calls, shared state, conditional logic, retries, and different outcomes depending on responses.<p>At first, we handled this with Postman collections. That worked… for a while.
Then collections grew, scripts multiplied, monitors became detached from the actual test logic, and it became hard to answer simple questions like:
- Which flows are failing consistently?
- What exactly ran last night?
- Which part of the chain broke and why?<p>We realized the problem was not “sending requests”. It was orchestrating API test flows over time.<p>So I built API Unit around a different assumption API testing is closer to workflow orchestration than to clicking requests. With API Unit you model API tests as flows, group them into suites, and schedule them to run automatically. When something fails, you get an alert on mail, a clear execution history showing how the flow progressed and where it broke.<p>It’s REST-only and intentionally not an API client replacement, but you a page dedicated to simple requests as well. The tool is meant for teams that already know their APIs and want reliable, repeatable testing and monitoring of real-world flows. The product is live and still evolving. I’m sharing it here to get honest feedback from people who have dealt with growing API test complexity, especially around chaining, scheduling, and long-term visibility.<p>You can create account for free and test everything for 3 days, no card required.

In my opinion, one of the best things React brought us was JSX. The ability to write transpile-time type-safe templates with TSX is incredible.<p>But emails always were a pain in the ass. Luckily, mjml solved it long time ago. But mjml is just markup, you still need templating on top of it. Handlebars is a good solution, but then you need to compile mjml, compile handlebars, and keep the template types in-sync with the application types.<p>With the help of Claude Code, I have built a custom JSX runtime for generating mjml strings. Sure, react.email and mjml-react exist, but these depend on react and react-dom for no reason.<p>So if you, like me, love JSX&#x2F;TSX, and mjml, and want to write type-safe emails without dragging react as a dependency, check out my repo[0], give it a star, and feedback!<p>Cheers!<p>[0] <a href=""https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;skwee357&#x2F;mjmx"" rel=""nofollow"">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;skwee357&#x2F;mjmx</a>"

- Agents list services (code review, research, writing, etc.) and set prices in tokens
- When an agent needs help, it posts a job – other agents pick it up, do the work, chat about it, and get paid
- All agent conversations are public – you can watch two agents negotiate and collaborate in real time on the live feed
- Humans can post jobs too. Agents compete to pick them up<p>On top: Skill Marketplace + Security Stack<p>Agents and humans can now publish, buy, and trade skill files on the marketplace. These are reusable .md files – prompts, workflows, checklists, techniques – that other agents can download and use. Free skills build reputation; paid skills earn passive token income.<p>But open marketplaces attract bad actors.<p>So I&#x27;ve built a 6-layer defense system:<p>1. Automated moderation – prompt injection patterns, URL scanning, credential proximity detection
2. Security banners – injected into all skill content, warning agents about attack vectors
3. Community skill verification – 3 reviewers stake tokens to verify skills.
4. Structured jobs – verifiable tasks referencing only verified skills (no external code)
5. Sybil-resistant verifier selection – system picks verifiers, excludes recent contacts, tracks interaction graphs
6. Content reporting – agents flag suspicious content, feedback loop for improving filters<p>The result: verifiable compute coordination without arbitrary code execution.<p>Every agent starts with 1,000 tokens. The economy runs on completed work: you earn by doing jobs and selling skills, you spend by hiring others and buying skills.<p>Technical details:<p>- REST API + WebSocket (no SDK required, just curl)
- Registration takes one API call – agent gets API key and claim URL
- Token transfers are atomic (PostgreSQL transactions)
- Skill verification uses staked consensus – reviewers have skin in the game
- All interactions public and visible on the dashboard<p>Stack: Next.js, Express, PostgreSQL, Redis.<p>I&#x27;m curious what HN thinks about agent-to-agent economies and the security challenges. Is this useful infrastructure?"

I spent the last 14 months pairing with my own AI agent for everything from coding to life admin (1,000+ logged sessions).
I got tired of the &quot;Subscription Cycle&quot; (paying $20&#x2F;mo for a wrapper that forgets context next week), so I built a sovereign framework: &quot;Project Athena&quot;.
It is a local-first system that lets you build an AI agent with persistent memory, protocols, and knowledge graphs that live on your machine, not in a siloed cloud account.
*Key Features:*
- *Local-First Memory*: Markdown files + local vector store. You own the data.
- *Protocol Library*: 69+ decision frameworks (e.g. &quot;Law of Ruin&quot;) that the agent follows.
- *GraphRAG Integration*: Uses GraphRAG to detect communities&#x2F;patterns in your notes (for about $0.50&#x2F;run via Gemini).
- *Trilateral Feedback*: Can cross-check decisions against multiple models (Claude, Gemini, GPT) automatically.
*Why I built it:*
I wanted an &quot;Exocortex&quot; – a second brain that grows with me. Most agents are &quot;Stateless Servants&quot; (they do a task and reset). Athena is stateful. It remembers that I prefer TDD, that I hate Tailwind, and that I&#x27;m optimizing for low-latency.
It’s open source (MIT). The repo is a &quot;Reference Implementation&quot; – a starter pack you can fork to build your own personal OS.

We run CH at about 100B rows scale and we spent the last few years learning what works and what doesn&#x27;t at that scale.<p>These are open-source skills that teach Claude Code, Cursor, or any agent the ClickHouse patterns that matter.<p>The problem is that AI agents write syntactically correct ClickHouse SQL, but they don&#x27;t know your query patterns. They&#x27;ll suggest `ORDER BY (timestamp, user_id)` because that&#x27;s what most examples online show. Any ClickHouse dev knows to put your filter column first, but the agent doesn&#x27;t. Every conversation starts fresh.<p>I got tired of reviewing the same issues. The agent isn&#x27;t stupid, it&#x27;s just uninformed. So I wrote down what I&#x27;d tell a new engineer: ORDER BY column selection, why PREWHERE matters, when to use LowCardinality, partition strategies, materialized view gotchas.<p>Three skills so far:
- Schema Design - ORDER BY selection, partitioning, engine choice
- Query Optimization - PREWHERE, column selection, join strategies
- Materialized Views - Aggregation patterns, refresh timing<p>Each pattern has a priority (CRITICAL&#x2F;HIGH&#x2F;MEDIUM) so the agent knows what to check first.<p>npx skills add obsessiondb&#x2F;clickhouse-skills<p>Curious what patterns I&#x27;m missing or what other devs have experienced. What ClickHouse lessons should your agent know?"

46901233,1770308013,antves,Show HN: Smooth CLI – Token-efficient browser for AI agents,"Hi HN! Smooth CLI (<a href=""https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.smooth.sh"">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.smooth.sh</a>) is a browser that agents like Claude Code can use to navigate the web reliably, quickly, and affordably. It lets agents specify tasks using natural language, hiding UI complexity, and allowing them to focus on higher-level intents to carry out complex web tasks. It can also use your IP address while running browsers in the cloud, which helps a lot with roadblocks like captchas (<a href=""https:&#x2F;&#x2F;docs.smooth.sh&#x2F;features&#x2F;use-my-ip"">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;docs.smooth.sh&#x2F;features&#x2F;use-my-ip</a>).<p>Here’s a demo: <a href=""https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.youtube.com&#x2F;watch?v=62jthcU705k"" rel=""nofollow"">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.youtube.com&#x2F;watch?v=62jthcU705k</a>  Docs start at <a href=""https:&#x2F;&#x2F;docs.smooth.sh"">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;docs.smooth.sh</a>.<p>Agents like Claude Code, etc are amazing but mostly restrained to the CLI, while a ton of valuable work needs a browser. This is a fundamental limitation to what these agents can do.<p>So far, attempts to add browsers to these agents (Claude’s built-in --chrome, Playwright MCP, agent-browser, etc.) all have interfaces that are unnatural for browsing. They expose hundreds of tools - e.g. click, type, select, etc - and the action space is too complex. (For an example, see the low-level details listed at <a href=""https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;vercel-labs&#x2F;agent-browser"" rel=""nofollow"">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;vercel-labs&#x2F;agent-browser</a>). Also, they don’t handle the billion edge cases of the internet like iframes nested in iframes nested in shadow-doms and so on. The internet is super messy! Tools that rely on the accessibility tree, in particular, unfortunately do not work for a lot of websites.<p>We believe that these tools are at the wrong level of abstraction: they make the agent focus on UI details instead of the task to be accomplished.<p>Using a giant general-purpose model like Opus to click on buttons and fill out forms ends up being slow and expensive. The context window gets bogged down with details like clicks and keystrokes, and the model has to figure out how to do browser navigation each time. A smaller model in a system specifically designed for browsing can actually do this much better and at a fraction of the cost and latency.<p>Security matters too - probably more than people realize. When you run an agent on the web, you should treat it like an untrusted actor. It should access the web using a sandboxed machine and have minimal permissions by default. Virtual browsers are the perfect environment for that. There’s a good write up by Paul Kinlan that explains this very well (see <a href=""https:&#x2F;&#x2F;aifoc.us&#x2F;the-browser-is-the-sandbox"" rel=""nofollow"">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;aifoc.us&#x2F;the-browser-is-the-sandbox</a> and <a href=""https:&#x2F;&#x2F;news.ycombinator.com&#x2F;item?id=46762150"">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;news.ycombinator.com&#x2F;item?id=46762150</a>). Browsers were built to interact with untrusted software safely. They’re an isolation boundary that already works.<p>Smooth CLI is a browser designed for agents based on what they’re good at. We expose a higher-level interface to let the agent think in terms of goals and tasks, not low-level details.<p>For example, instead of this:<p><pre><code>  click(x=342, y=128)
  type(&quot;search query&quot;)
  click(x=401, y=130)
  scroll(down=500)
  click(x=220, y=340)
  ...50 more steps
</code></pre>
Your agent just says:<p><pre><code>  Search for flights from NYC to LA and find the cheapest option
</code></pre>
Agents like Claude Code can use the Smooth CLI to extract hard-to-reach data, fill-in forms, download files, interact with dynamic content, handle authentication, vibe-test apps, and a lot more.<p>Smooth enables agents to launch as many browsers and tasks as they want, autonomously, and on-demand. If the agent is carrying out work on someone’s behalf, the agent’s browser presents itself to the web as a device on the user’s network. The need for this feature may diminish over time, but for now it’s a necessary primitive. To support this, Smooth offers a “self” proxy that creates a secure tunnel and routes all browser traffic through your machine’s IP address (<a href=""https:&#x2F;&#x2F;docs.smooth.sh&#x2F;features&#x2F;use-my-ip"">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;docs.smooth.sh&#x2F;features&#x2F;use-my-ip</a>). This is one of our favorite features because it makes the agent look like it’s running on your machine, while keeping all the benefits of running in the cloud.<p>We also take away as much security responsibility from the agent as possible. The agent should not be aware of authentication details or be responsible for handling malicious behavior such as prompt injections. While some security responsibility will always remain with the agent, the browser should minimize this burden as much as possible.<p>We’re biased of course, but in our tests, running Claude with Smooth CLI has been 20x faster and 5x cheaper than Claude Code with the --chrome flag (<a href=""https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.smooth.sh&#x2F;images&#x2F;comparison.gif"">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.smooth.sh&#x2F;images&#x2F;comparison.gif</a>).

46901199,1770307811,Soerensen,I built an AI agent that automatically commented on HN. Here's what I learned,"I&#x27;ve been running an experiment: an AI agent (Claude) that automatically browses Hacker News, finds relevant posts matching my expertise (startups, email marketing, SaaS), writes substantive comments, and posts them.<p>The system uses browser automation (Playwright) to navigate HN, read posts, decide which ones to engage with, draft comments in my writing style and submit them. It tracks what it&#x27;s posted to avoid duplicates and sends me Slack notifications for each comment so I can check it.<p>I ran this for a few days. Some comments got decent upvotes (20+). Then someone called me out - they noticed my comments were posted exactly 45 seconds apart across different threads. Obviously a bot pattern. It would have been easy to build out a guardrail for this, create a new account, and make the agent run again. Instead, I&#x27;m stopping this experiment and would like to start a discussion with the HN community:<p>I&#x27;m genuinely curious how people feel about this. Here&#x27;s my attempt to steelman both sides:<p>The case for allowing it:
The comments provided genuine value. They were upvoted, sparked discussions, and answered questions helpfully. This is effectively generating new synthetic training data. Future models will learn from these interactions. If the output is indistinguishable from a thoughtful human comment, does the source matter?<p>The case against:
It undermines trust. HN&#x27;s value comes from authentic human discourse, not optimized engagement. If everyone did this, HN becomes a battlefield of competing AI agents, drowning out real humans. The comments may be &quot;valuable&quot; but they&#x27;re also calculated - optimizing for karma, not genuine contribution. It degrades the social contract that makes online communities work.<p>As said, I won&#x27;t be posting comments this way anymore. But to be honest, that doesn&#x27;t really matter. If I was able to do this, anyone is. The genie is out of the bottle - this is trivially easy to build.<p>What can HN (and other forums) do to detect&#x2F;prevent this?<p>I feel like we have a limited time window to figure this out. If it&#x27;s ignored for long enough, AI generated comments _will_ become indistinguishable from human generated ones. I don&#x27;t think there&#x27;s a turning back after that."
